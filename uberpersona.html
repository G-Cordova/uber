			<p>
				My name is Art Vandalay. I am an marine biologist. I am using my IPhone 7 to do anything on the internet in any situation. I am very confident is using my smartphone to do various things. I am a millenial male at the age of 19. My frustration I've experienced with other apps is that they are always late and unreliable. I hate taking taxis or cabs. I just want to "get from 'Point A' to 'Point B'" when I need to and most importantly; on time.
